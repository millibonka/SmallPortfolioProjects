I usually have problems getting dressed in appropriate clothes for the weather - I either end up carrying my jacket in my hand like an idiot when it's clearly too warm for a jacket, or I'm freezing, because I did not take a jacket with me. So as a rising ML/DL/AI star, I decided to make a model that would predict the choice of attire for me. 

Right now I'm in the process of gathering data and you're very welcome to help me. I have a short script that fetches current weather conditions and gives you a choice of clothing that you feel is appropriate. 

With time (I'm thinking at least a year to get all the possible weather conditions - I live in a four-season climate), there should be enough data to train a simple model to give me right predictions. 

For science!
